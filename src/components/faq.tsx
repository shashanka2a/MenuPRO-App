    question: "How much does MenuPRO cost?",
    answer: "MenuPRO costs just $19/month with no commission fees. This is significantly less than Square ($69+/month) and Toast ($79+/month). You keep 100% of your revenue with our flat-rate pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer: "Setup takes just 15 minutes on average. Simply upload your menu, generate QR codes, and you're ready to start taking digital orders. No technical expertise required."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any special equipment?",
    answer: "No special equipment needed! Customers use their own smartphones to scan QR codes and place orders. You just need a device to manage orders (tablet, phone, or computer)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use MenuPRO for multiple locations?",
    answer: "Yes! MenuPRO supports unlimited locations with centralized management. Each location gets its own QR codes and can have different menus, pricing, and settings."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if customers don't have smartphones?",
    answer: "We provide backup options including printed menus with QR codes and staff-assisted ordering. Our system works on any device with a camera and internet connection."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial with no credit card required. You can test all features and see how MenuPRO works for your restaurant before committing."
